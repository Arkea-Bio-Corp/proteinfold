# nf-core/proteinfold: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and predicts protein structures using the following methods:

- [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)
- [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) - MMseqs2 API server followed by ColabFold
- [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) - MMseqs2 local search followed by ColabFold

### AlphaFold2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `AlphaFold2/`
  - `<SEQUENCE NAME>/` that contains the computed MSAs, unrelaxed structures, relaxed structures, ranked structures, raw model outputs, prediction metadata, and section timings
  - `<SEQUENCE NAME>.alphafold.pdb` that is the structure with the highest pLDDT score (ranked first)
- `DBs/` that contains symbolic links to the downloaded database and parameter files

</details>

### ColabFold

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `colabfold_webserver/` or `colabfold_local/` based on the selected mode that contains the computed MSAs, unrelaxed structures, relaxed structures, ranked structures, raw model outputs and scores, prediction metadata, logs and section timings
- `DBs/` that contains symbolic links to the downloaded database and parameter files

</details>

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
